    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is a widely used data science methodology that provides a structured approach for planning and executing data mining projects. It helps organizations turn raw data into meaningful insights to support business decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The methodology is flexible and can be applied across industries such as retail, finance, healthcare, and marketing. CRISP-DM consists of six phases—Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment—that guide the entire process from identifying problems to delivering actionable results.
    </p>
    <p>
        Its systematic and iterative approach ensures that data projects remain aligned with business goals and maintain high quality throughout.
